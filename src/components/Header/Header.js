const expText = "Chopin used a technique of moving between chords that didn't depend on functional harmony but on chromatic closeness. " +
  "The chords would gently fold chromatically into each other, and it \"worked\" because the chords shared notes in common and the other notes voice led gracefully. " +
  "I've also seen a few jazz compositions that work similarly. " +
  "This app was made to make it easy to find chords that share a lot in common with the starting chord. " +
  "The D0 column tells how many notes are in common, D1 how many are one semi-tone away, etc. " +
  "The \"score\" is a measure of the \"closeness\" of the two chords, with the D0 score weighted more heavily than the D1, etc."
